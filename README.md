`dapple` is a tool for Solidity developers to help build and manage complex contract systems on Ethereum-like blockchains.

`dapple` is a Solidity developer multitool concerned primarily with managing the growing complexity of interconnected smart contract systems. Its core functionality encompasses *package management*, *build process*, and *deployment scripting*. These concepts are related in a way that is unique to the smart contract ecosystem, due to each blockchain's universal singleton nature. The central data model is the `dappfile`, whose definition depends on IPFS and also on the Ethereum blockchain specifically.

#### Installation
