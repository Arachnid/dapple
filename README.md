`dapple` is a Solidity developer multitool concerned primarily with managing the growing complexity of interconnected smart contract systems. Its core functionality encompasses *package management*, *build process*, and *deployment scripting*. These concepts are related in a way that is unique to the smart contract ecosystem, due to each blockchain's universal singleton nature. The central data model is the `dappfile`, whose definition depends on IPFS and also on the Ethereum blockchain specifically.

#### Installation

`npm install -g dapple`

#### Basic Usage

##### Create a package directory
```
mkdir mydapp && cd mydapp
dapple init
```

`dapple init` generates a simple boilerplate `dappfile` in the current
directory.

If no errors are displayed, the initialization was a success. You should be able
to see the boilerplate `dappfile` in your current directory, along with a couple
other directories:

```
$ ls
build  contracts  dappfile
```

By default, `build` is where the output of `dapple build` gets put, and
`contracts` is where Dapple looks for your contract source files. Both of these
are configured in your `dappfile` and can be overridden.



Write a contract and test (see [dapple test harness docs](https:github.com/nexusdev/dapple/doc/test.md)).

```
vim contracts/dapp.sol
vim contracts/dapp_test.sol
dapple test
```

By default, dapple builds the entire `contracts` tree, and emits the following:
* dapple build cache objects
* `classes.json`, all type definitions
* `js_module.js`, a javascript module which wrapps classes.json and adds instantiated web3js Contract objects for each object in the dappfile.

```
dapple build
```
